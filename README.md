# Delta-Forcasting
The code uses the yfinance library to fetch stock data and perform delta predictions using linear regression. 
The script retrieves historical stock data for each symbol, calculates the daily delta, and trains a linear regression model. 
It then uses the trained model to predict the delta for the next day based on the most recent data.
